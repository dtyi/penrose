# penrose

This module contains three components:
 - p3, a system of tiles with which to construct Penrose tiling 3 (thick and thin rhombs)
 - sumz, classes for cyclotomic integers, aka the elements of a Kummer ring, specifically of the fifth roots of unity. These (complex) numbers are exact representations of points within a Penrose tiling.
 - objmatrix, a subclass of numpy ndarrays that allows for matrix (dot) products to work with dtype object.
